"""
Shared attendance-export source for HR/payroll integrations (SeamlessHR, Business Central).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Both integrations previously built their payloads from RAW iclock_transaction rows using a
first-punch/last-punch heuristic. That was wrong in three ways:

  • Access-control door swipes are written to iclock_transaction too (ADMS writes a T&A row
    for ACCESS_ENTRY/EXIT readers), so "first swipe → last swipe" billed door movement as
    work hours — systematically over-stating time.
  • A single `punch_time::date` filter mis-attributed cross-midnight / night shifts.
  • The day boundary was UTC, splitting local workdays.

The system already computes correct, shift-aware, break-aware, reader_purpose-respecting
attendance into the `att_report` table (via attendance_calculation_service). This module makes
that the single source of truth for BOTH exporters, and attaches a stable idempotency key per
(employee, date) so re-runs/retries cannot double-post to payroll.
